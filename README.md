# typscript-discord-bot
A very simple discord bot written in typescript

## To run this code, you will need to install the following dependencies:

discord.js: The official Discord API library for Node.js
dotenv: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env
You can install these dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in your terminal:

npm install discord.js dotenv

Make sure to run this command in the same directory where your code file is located.


It is required that you have Node.js installed and run npm install discord.js in your project directory to install the Discord.js library. Then, you can run the code with node your-script-name.js after creating a .env file with your actual bot token in it.
