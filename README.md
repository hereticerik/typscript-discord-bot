# typscript-discord-bot
A very simple discord bot written in typescript

To run this code, you'll need to have Node.js installed and run npm install discord.js in your project directory to install the Discord.js library. Then, you can run the code with node your-script-name.js after replacing 'your-bot-token-here' with your actual bot token.
